# NoteTaker
Attempt at making a note taking app using java and html

Unfortunately, due to my ignorance, I did not understand that this program only works on local networks.
Therefore, this website will never be up. You may access this website, and it will showcase a
basic skeleton of what could be a note-taking website, however, unless you have the program
running on your own computer and have a local network where you can run the html. This
program will never run.

This does not mean this program does not work, I lack the funds to pay for a server to 
run a note-taking app.
